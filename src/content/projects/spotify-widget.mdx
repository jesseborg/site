	Spotify Widget is a small desktop app that shows information about the current playing song from Spotify. It uses a thin wrapper around the Windows API, that I built in Rust.

	This was one of the first projects I built when I began learning Rust, so that portion of the code isn't the best it could be.
	
	If I were to start this project over again I'd probably just use the Spotify API, even if this means that the app would need an internet connection to work.

		It's currently not available for download, but you can try an example of what the UI is like above and of course you can also view the source code.
	</span>
