This is a web-based image cropping tool I created as a learning exercise to help better my skills with React. It has full keyboard access from uploading, cropping and downloading.

While creating this app I also used the [@use-gesture](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/) library for the first time and is actually what motivated me to create my own smaller <a target="_blank" href={`https://github.com/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_USERNAME}/pinboard/blob/main/src/hooks/use-drag.tsx`}>useDrag</a> hook in my [Pinboard](/projects/pinboard-app) app

The cropping and 'uploading' is done completely client side and even works completely offline with the support of a service worker.
