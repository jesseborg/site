This is a small, lightweight infinite Pinboard application.

My motivation stemmed from a personal challenge to minimize reliance on too many external libraries, but also because I wanted to challenge myself too see if I could even create them myself.

The app has complete keyboard accessibility, including arrow key navigation where needed.

For a demonstration, please see the live demo above and if you're curious you can also view the source code.
