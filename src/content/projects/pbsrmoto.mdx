This is the [official site](https://pbsrmoto.com.au) for my brother's business that I made in late 2022.

It's one of the first websites that I ever made, and I'm really proud of what I achieved.
However, having said that, there is a lot that I would do differently if I were to ever remake it.

The backend uses TRPC and Prisma with PostgreSQL, and images are stored on a self-hosted 'S3 bucket' using the Minio open source software.

I also created a custom dashboard for the admins where they can upload or create products and collections of products.

If you would like to know more about this project, please get in contact with me.
