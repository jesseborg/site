This is the [official site](https://pbsrmoto.com.au) for my brother's business that I made in late 2022.

It's one of the first websites that I ever made (this is not the first version, though), and I'm really proud of what I was able to achieve at the time.
However, looking back there is a lot that I would do differently if I were to ever remake it.

The backend uses TRPC and Prisma with PostgreSQL, and all images are stored on a self-hosted 'S3 bucket' using the [Minio](https://min.io/) open source software.

I also created a custom dashboard for the admins where they can upload or edit/create products and collections of products.
